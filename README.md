The idea is to create Solar System simulation.

Basic Setup:
1. Nine planets + the Sun are visible in correct order
2. Planets can rotate around the Sun with relative speeds
3. Stop/Start button allows to control planets rotation

Extra Setup:
4. Relative rotation speed can be changed by user
5. Rotation direction can be changed by user
6. On hover user can see planet details
